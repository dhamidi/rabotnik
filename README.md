# Rabotnik

Rabotnik is an example application for a series of articles about Event Sourcing.  You can find the article introducing Rabotnik here: https://dario-hamidi.de/posts/introducing-rabotnik.html

Care has been taken to write proper commits, following the TDD approach.  Looking through the commit log should give the reader a good overview of how the application has been developed in small steps.
